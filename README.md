In this Research Project, we analyzed the mechanics of a Double Pendulum, a chaotic non-linear system. Using small-angle approximation and techniques to solve systems of
linear differential equations, we found an approximate analytical solution for the equations of motion. We then used numerical methods to simulate the chaotic behaviour of the exact
solutions at different initial values, and compared how the chaotic behaviour deviated from the predicted approximate behaviour qualitatively.
